<h1>Simple-react-calculator</h1>

A React calculator built with [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react), [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) and [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).</p> I've used [this calculator design concept](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/calculator-animation-icons) which is designed by Maximiliano Catani.

## Live Demo

You can test on https://ac-react-calculator.netlify.com

## Running Locally

1. Clone this repo
2. Type `cd simple-Calculator-ReactJS` to enter the project folder

4. Run `npm start` and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Build

1. The compiled version will be in `/build/`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
